# Movies Reservations System 
This sample designs and implementation of movies booking system that show the available movies in the cinema and display menu choices to the user. It prompts the user to choose the movie name. then display another choice related to the chosen movie.
The main idea is to reserve a ticket. where it prompts the user to enter adult ticket count, child ticket count, senior ticket count. Then calculate and print the total price that the user should pay. if the user agrees with price he can check out and return to main menu.
This project is useful because it makes the user explore the movie choices and book the ticket in advance online.
